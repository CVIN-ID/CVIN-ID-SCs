# Implementation II: ERC-725 Proxy Account Standard

## Overview

This repository details the implementation of the ERC-725 Proxy Account standard, optimized for managing decentralized identities (DIDs) and digital assets specifically tailored for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Utilizing the ERC-725 standard, this implementation ensures that each vehicle maintains a secure and verifiable identity on the blockchain with flexible data management.

## Components

### ERC-725 Proxy Account

The ERC-725 Proxy Account contract is the fundamental component responsible for managing decentralized identities and their associated data. This includes the creation, updating, and management of various data types through a proxy account mechanism.

#### Key Functions
- **Key Management**: Facilitates the addition, updating, and removal of keys associated with the proxy account.
- **Data Management**: Allows for storing and retrieving various types of data linked to the proxy account.
- **Proxy Execution**: Enables the execution of arbitrary smart contract calls through the proxy account.

#### Role in ERC-725
The ERC-725 Proxy Account provides the foundational layer for managing decentralized identities and their associated data, ensuring flexibility and security on the blockchain. It directly supports the key features of ERC-725, such as key management, data handling, and proxy execution.

### ERC-725 Identity Management

The ERC-725 Identity Management component is essential for associating and managing identities with the proxy account. It defines a standard way to manage attributes and permissions linked to a decentralized identity.

#### Key Functions
- **Add Key**: Adds a new key to the identity with specific permissions.
- **Remove Key**: Removes an existing key from the identity.
- **Set Data**: Associates data with the identity, allowing for flexible attribute management.

#### Role in ERC-725
The ERC-725 Identity Management component plays a vital role in managing identities through the proxy account. This allows applications to easily manage identity attributes and permissions, ensuring interoperability and usability within the ERC-725 framework.

### ERC-725 Data Management

The ERC-725 Data Management component provides an interface for managing various types of data linked to the proxy account. It allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data, supporting flexible identity management.

#### Key Features
- **Store Data**: Allows for storing data in the proxy account.
- **Retrieve Data**: Facilitates retrieving data from the proxy account.
- **Manage Permissions**: Enables setting permissions for data access and management.

#### Role in ERC-725
The ERC-725 Data Management component enhances the functionality of the proxy account by providing flexible data management mechanisms. This supports the broader adoption of ERC-725 by enabling scalable and efficient identity and data management.

## Integration and Functionality

### How They Work Together
1. **Identity and Key Management**: Developers use the ERC-725 Proxy Account to manage decentralized identities and their associated keys. These identities are registered on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-725 standard.
2. **Data Management**: Data associated with the identities is managed through the ERC-725 Data Management component. The proxy account provides an interface for these operations.
3. **Proxy Execution**: When an application needs to execute smart contract calls through the proxy account, it uses the ERC-725 Proxy Execution feature. This ensures secure and flexible execution of various operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- Truffle
- Ganache

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CVIN-ID/CVIN-ID-SCs.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the ERC725 implementation directory:
    ```bash
    cd CVIN-ID-SCs/ERC725
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Deployment

1. Start Ganache:
    ```bash
    ganache-cli
    ```

2. Compile and deploy the contracts:
    ```bash
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```

### Testing

Run the test cases to ensure the smart contracts work as expected:
    ```bash
    truffle test
    ```

## Comparison with Other Standards

### ERC1056-Based Implementation

- **Proxy Accounts vs. Direct Management**: ERC1056 manages DIDs and attributes directly on the blockchain, whereas ERC725 uses proxy accounts for flexible data management. This provides ERC725 with more flexibility but added complexity.
- **Attribute Storage**: ERC1056 directly manages attributes linked to DIDs, while ERC725 allows for flexible data management through proxy accounts.
- **Standardization and Resolution**: ERC1056 inherently supports the resolution of identity information into standardized formats through the Ethr-DID Resolver. ERC725 requires additional mechanisms to translate on-chain proxy account information into standardized formats.

### ERC721-Based Implementation

- **Unique Tokens vs. Proxy Accounts**: ERC721 employs non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent unique digital identities, while ERC725 uses proxy accounts for flexible data and identity management.
- **Data Management**: ERC721 manages attributes as metadata within the tokens, whereas ERC725 provides flexible data management through proxy accounts.
- **Key Management**: Both ERC721 and ERC725 support secure key management, but ERC725 achieves this through proxy account mechanisms, providing a streamlined approach.
