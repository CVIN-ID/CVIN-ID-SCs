# Implementation III: ERC-1056 Lightweight Identity

## Overview
This implementation variation focuses on utilizing the ERC-1056 standard for lightweight identity management of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). By leveraging the efficient and minimalistic nature of ERC-1056, we aim to create a streamlined identity management system that ensures each vehicle has a unique and verifiable identity on the blockchain.

### ERC-1056 Standard
ERC-1056, also known as the Lightweight Identity standard, offers a minimalistic and efficient approach to managing Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The primary objective of ERC-1056 is to provide a straightforward solution for creating and managing DIDs without the complexity and overhead associated with more comprehensive identity management systems.

#### Key Features
1. **DID Creation and Management**: Facilitates the creation, updating, and deactivation of DIDs on the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Attribute Management**: Supports the addition, updating, and removal of attributes associated with DIDs.
3. **Key Rotation**: Enables secure key management by allowing the rotation of keys linked to a DID.
4. **Event Logging**: Maintains a log of all events related to the DID, ensuring transparency and traceability.

### Implementation Details

#### Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
In this implementation, each CAV is assigned a unique DID using the ERC-1056 standard. The DID is created and managed through the registry contract, which ensures immutability and security. The `createDID` function registers new DIDs as follows:
```solidity
function createDID(address owner) external returns (bytes32 did) {
    did = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(owner, block.timestamp));
    emit DIDCreated(did, owner);
}
```
This method guarantees that each DID is unique and securely managed.

#### Attribute Management
Attributes associated with the DIDs are managed using the `setAttribute` and `removeAttribute` functions. These attributes can include vital information about the vehicle, such as make, model, and year:
```solidity
function setAttribute(bytes32 did, bytes32 name, bytes32 value) external {
    require(didOwners[did] == msg.sender, "Not authorized");
    attributes[did][name] = value;
    emit AttributeSet(did, name, value);
}

function removeAttribute(bytes32 did, bytes32 name) external {
    require(didOwners[did] == msg.sender, "Not authorized");
    delete attributes[did][name];
    emit AttributeRemoved(did, name);
}
```
These functions ensure that attributes are securely managed and verifiable.

#### Key Management and Rotation
ERC-1056 supports secure key management through key rotation, which is essential for maintaining the security of DIDs over time. The `rotateKey` function allows the owner of a DID to update the associated keys:
```solidity
function rotateKey(bytes32 did, address newKey) external {
    require(didOwners[did] == msg.sender, "Not authorized");
    keys[did] = newKey;
    emit KeyRotated(did, newKey);
}
```
This mechanism ensures that the DID remains secure even if the original key is compromised.

## Comparison with ERC721 Implementation

### ERC721-Based Implementation
- **Nature of Tokens**: ERC721 is designed for non-fungible tokens, making each token unique. This uniqueness is leveraged for DIDs in CAVs, ensuring that each vehicle has a distinct identity.
- **Metadata**: Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are stored as metadata within the ERC721 tokens, linking additional information to the DIDs.
- **Ownership and Transfer**: ERC721â€™s built-in functions handle ownership and transfer of tokens, ensuring secure management of digital identities.
- **Security and Immutability**: The immutable nature of the blockchain ensures that DIDs and VCs cannot be altered or tampered with, providing a high level of security.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for applications where distinct, non-interchangeable identities are necessary, such as CAVs.

### ERC-1056 Lightweight Identity
- **Efficiency**: ERC-1056 is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for applications where simplicity and minimal overhead are paramount.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for flexible attribute management and key rotation, tailored for dynamic identity management needs.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for decentralized identity management where efficiency and simplicity are crucial.

## Comparison with ERC725 Implementation

### ERC725-Based Implementation
- **Proxy Accounts**: ERC725 focuses on creating proxy accounts that can hold and manage various types of data, including identity information.
- **Extensibility**: ERC725x and ERC725y extend the base standard, providing additional functionalities for more complex identity management.
- **Flexibility**: Highly flexible in managing different types of identity-related data and executing operations.
- **Security and Control**: Offers robust security features and fine-grained control over identity data and operations.
- **Use Case**: Best suited for comprehensive identity management systems requiring extensive data handling and complex operations.

### ERC-1056 Lightweight Identity
- **Simplicity**: More straightforward compared to ERC725, focusing solely on DIDs without the added complexity of proxy accounts.
- **Attribute Management**: Allows for easy addition, updating, and removal of attributes directly on the DID, without needing a separate account structure.
- **Key Management**: Provides robust key rotation and delegation mechanisms.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be scalable for large-scale DID management without the overhead of complex proxy accounts.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for straightforward, scalable DID management systems with less need for complex data handling and operations.

## Summary
The ERC-1056 Lightweight Identity standard provides an efficient and straightforward approach to managing DIDs on the Ethereum blockchain. This implementation is particularly suitable for applications requiring minimal overhead and high efficiency. In contrast, the ERC721-based implementation leverages the uniqueness of NFTs for secure, non-fungible digital identities, making it ideal for applications like CAVs. The ERC725-based implementation offers a comprehensive and flexible solution for complex identity management needs, extending beyond simple DID management to encompass extensive data handling and proxy operations.

By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, we can choose the most appropriate standard for their specific use case, ensuring the best balance of security, flexibility, and scalability.
