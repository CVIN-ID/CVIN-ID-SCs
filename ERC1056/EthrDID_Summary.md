# Ethr-DID


### Ethr-DID

#### Overview
Ethr-DID is a JavaScript library that simplifies the creation and management of DIDs within applications. It provides developers with tools to interact with the Ethereum DID Registry and the Ethr-DID Resolver, streamlining the integration of decentralized identities into their projects.

#### Key Features
1. **DID Creation**: Allows developers to programmatically create new DIDs.
2. **Attribute Management**: Provides functions to add, update, and remove attributes associated with DIDs.
3. **Key Management**: Facilitates key rotation and delegation, ensuring secure identity management.

#### Role in ERC-1056
The Ethr-DID library acts as a bridge between application developers and the underlying Ethereum DID infrastructure. By abstracting the complexities of smart contract interactions, it enables seamless integration of DIDs into various applications, supporting the broader adoption of ERC-1056.
